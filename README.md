# Pathfinder

![](https://travis-ci.org/D-L-M/pathfinder.svg?branch=master)

Pathfinder is a simple JavaScript library that allows you to create a grid complete with traversable and non-traversable blocks, then plot the quickest path between two points.

## Getting Started

To compile the Pathfinder library, run `npm install` and then `gulp all`. The library will be compiled and minified to `dist/pathfinder.min.js`.
